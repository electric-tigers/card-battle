This app is currently entirely client-side. There is no server-side component. You can get started easily using ‚ö°StackBlitz by clicking the <kbd>Open in Codeflow</kbd> button above. All of the API data model stuff should go in [`src/model.ts`](src/model.ts). If it ever overflows a single file, make a `src/model/` folder and put the files in there with a `src/model/index.ts` exporting the important bits. The UI actual _on the screen_ bits can start out all in [`src/App.tsx`](src/App.tsx) as one big file. If that gets too big the code can be split out into multiple files in `src/*.tsx`.

- **`npm run dev`:** Runs the Vite dev server so you can see a live reloading preview of your code as you edit it.
- **`npm run format`:** Formats all the code using Prettier. Run this every so often.
- **`npm run build`:** Compiles everything into an `index.html` and associated JavaScript and CSS files. This is what GitHub Actions will run before deploying this site to GitHub Pages.

### Cool tools

This is Jacob's list of cool tech tools that were shown off at some point in team meetings.

- **[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/):** No-configuration Node.js dev env for frontend & light backend.
- **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/):** Great for low pressure crude sketches and diagrams when you need digital pen & paper.
- **[XState](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate):** Makes diagrams, simulations, and more out of your state machine code!
- **[Stately.ai editor](https://stately.ai/editor):** The company behind XState also makes a visual flowchart editor.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** The current best frontend build system.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** The best way to write JavaScript with type declarations.
- **[v0](https://v0.dev/):** AI code generator focused on React & Tailwind CSS
- **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/):** General purpose AI chatbot that can generate code.
- **[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/):** Alternative to ChatGPT that supports image inputs on the free tier.
- **[Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com/):** Completely free no signup image generator AI.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** Put your CSS in your HTML instead of fragile linking to another file.
- **[React](https://react.dev/):** The biggest JavaScript UI framework right now.
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/):** The most popular JavaScript ecosystem code formatter.
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/):** Vite-based testing framework. Supports TypeScript out of the box.
- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/):** Premade components to copy-paste into your React+TailwindCSS project.
- **[Greptile](https://greptile.com/):** Give ChatGPT the context of your entire GitHub repository.
- **[Immer]():** Immutable JavaScript objects with ergonomic & memory efficient copiers.

### JavaScript tips

- Classes get named in PascalCase like Java.
- Methods get named in camelCase also like Java.
- Single-export files _usually_ are named after said export exactly. `export default function App() { ... }` usually is called `App.tsx`
- Multi-export files are named in kebab-case after a generic group name that is inclusive of all the symbols. Like `game.ts`.
- In general, string literals are used for enums instead of number maps. For example it's `doThing("enum-value")` not `doThing(MyEnum.EnumValue)`.
- Use [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) to find reference docs on JavaScript or Web API builtins.
- Don't try to put too much in a single file; break things up logically.
- When using generic names and the auto-import feature of TypeScript's LSP intellisense make sure you pick the right import. Don't accidentally import `Model` from some internal Vite file or `get` from Node.js `http`.
- Use `const` where possible. It's the most restrictive variable declarator. You can still mutate the underlying object but you can't reassign it.
- When using React **all `useState()` and other hooks must be unconditionally called**. No `if (false) { useState() }`.
- Avoid JSX UI logic in statements. Try to keep JSX focused on the big `return <>...</>` block. Prefer multiple micro-components.
- Avoid redundant JavaDoc-style comments. TypeScript does a lot of the work for you in documenting the important "this is a number" bits.
- When it makes sense it's OK to use a library. It's very easy to do: just `npm install <library>` and `import { ... } from "<library>"`.
- JavaScript does have getters and setters for properties. That means you can intercept `object.property` with a `get property() { return 42 }` function that will be called whenever the `property` field is accessed.
